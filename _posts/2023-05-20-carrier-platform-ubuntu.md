## Installation
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing Carrier on Ubuntu operating systems. 
Carrier is a powerful platform for performance and security testing. 

### Prerequisites

To install Carrier successfully, your Linux host must meet the following hardware requirements (CPU, RAM, Disk):

| Minimal Hardware requirements |                    |
|--------------------------------|--------------------|
| CPU                            | 4 (and more)        |
| RAM                            | 16 GB (and more)    |
| Disk                           | 100-500GB (root drive or mounted drive) |
| IP address or DNS              | Static              |
| Inbound ports                  | http â€“ 80, ssh - 22, tcp - 3100, http - 5672(rabbitmq), http - 8086 (influxdb)|

As a load generator it is recommended to use separate virtual machine:

| Load generator hardware minimal requirements  |                    |
|--------------------------------|--------------------|
| CPU                            | 2 (and more)       |
| RAM                            | 8 GB (and more)    |


> Please note that the specifications mentioned above are recommendations and can be adjusted based on your specific requirements and workload. Make sure to choose the appropriate instance types or virtual machine sizes that align with the Carrier instance requirements.

### Cloud Provider Recommendations

#### AWS
For Carrier installation on AWS, you can use EC2 instances that meet the following specifications:
- Instance Type: `m5.large` or higher
- vCPUs: 4 or more
- RAM: 16 GB or more
- Root Volume: 100-500GB SSD
- IP: Assign a static IP to the instance

#### Azure
For Carrier installation on Azure, you can use virtual machines that meet the following specifications:
- Virtual Machine Size: `Standard_D4s_v3` or higher
- vCPUs: 4 or more
- RAM: 16 GB or more
- OS Disk: 100-500GB Premium SSD
- IP: Assign a static IP to the virtual machine

> For Azure it is reccomended to disable daily updates to avoid Docker restarts:

1. Check if you have any daily services enabled using the following command:
```bash
$ sudo systemctl list-timers
```
The following services should be stopped/disabled: `apt-daily-upgrade.service`, `apt-daily.service`.

2. Disable the timer services:
```bash
$ sudo systemctl stop apt-daily-upgrade.timer
$ sudo systemctl disable apt-daily-upgrade.timer
$ sudo systemctl stop apt-daily.timer
$ sudo systemctl disable apt-daily.timer
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
After disabling, ensure that the disabled services are not running anymore using the following command:
3. Run next:
```bash
$ sudo systemctl list-timers
```

#### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
For Carrier installation on GCP, you can use Compute Engine instances that meet the following specifications:
- Machine Type: `n1-standard-4` or higher
- vCPUs: 4 or more
- RAM: 16 GB or more
- Boot Disk: 100-500GB SSD
- IP: Assign a static IP to the instance

#### Software

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/ubuntu/) 4.19.0+:
```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install docker.io -y
```

2. Install Docker [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/):
```bash
$ sudo apt install docker-compose
```
> Make sure you're got no errors after the build step command.

5. If the hardware drive is not the root drive, mount the disk to the /opt directory.
> Please find how to mount disk steps by the link: [how](#how-to-mount-disks)

6. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 2.40.1+ :
- Check if Git is installed using the following command:
```bash
$ git --version
```
- Otherwise, install it:
```bash
$ sudo apt install git
```

### Steps
1. Using root user clone the carrier-io centry repository to the /opt directory:
```bash
$ cd /opt
$ git clone https://github.com/carrier-io/centry.git -b next
```

2. Navigate to the downloaded folder:
```bash
$ cd centry
```
> 05/2/29 `beta-1.0` branch to release

9. Get the `public IP` of your system and set the `CURRENT_IP` variable to the defined value:
```bash
$ CURRENT_IP=$(host myip.opendns.com resolver1.opendns.com | grep 'address ' | cut -d ' ' -f 4)
```

10. In the `.env` file, change `DEV_IP` to `CURRENT_IP`:
```bash
$ sed -i -e "s/\$DEV_IP/$CURRENT_IP/g" .env
```

11. Create a new config file:
```bash
$ cp config/pylon-example.yml config/pylon.yml
```

12. Launch the Carrier installer:
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

```bash
$ docker logs -f carrier-pylon-auth
```

> You're all set, then! Excellent Work! 


## How to create a project in Carrier

1. Once you log in, you will see a page indicating that there are no projects created yet.
    ![Carrier after login](/assets/posts_img/main_page.png)

2. Click on the person logo in the top right corner and select "Administration" to switch to Administration mode and create your first project.

3. Click on the plus sign to add the project. Set the name of your project and click "Create".

    3.1 Open ![Carrier plus btn](/assets/posts_img/plus_project.png)


    3.2 Save ![Carrier set name ](/assets/posts_img/set_name_prj.png)

4. Your project will be created. It might take around 1 minute. You can track the process of project creation in the carrier-pylon logs to ensure that there are no errors.

    ```bash
$ docker logs -f carrier-pylon 
``` 

5. Once the project is created, you can switch back to Project mode.

## Troubleshooting

1. Restart main container 

```bash
$ docker restart carrier-pylon
$ docker logs -f carrier-pylon
```

If something doesn't work as expected, check the logs of the following containers for any errors:

```bash
$ docker logs -f carrier-keycloak
$ docker logs -f centry_traefik_1
$ docker logs -f carrier-pylon-auth
```

### How to mount disks
1. Get the list of all available partitions on your system with the following command:
    ```bash
$ sudo fdisk -l
```

2. Make a new file system:
    ```bash
$ sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/nvme1n1
```

3. Add information about the new filesystem in the file system table by editing /etc/fstab:
    ```bash
$ sudo vi /etc/fstab
```

4. Add the following line at the end of the file:
    ```
/dev/nvme1n1    /opt   ext4    defaults     0        2
```

5. Mount the required file system to the existing /opt directory:
    ```bash
$ sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1 /opt
```

6. Mount Docker to the /opt folder:
    ```bash
$ cd /opt
$ sudo mkdir docker
$ sudo service docker stop
$ sudo mount --rbind /opt/docker /var/lib/docker
$ sudo service docker start
```

## Uninstall
If the root volume was used as the hard drive, use the following commands to stop containers and remove all required artifacts:
```bash
$ docker-compose down
$ docker volume prune
$ docker network prune
```

If a mounted disk was used, manually delete all directories with images:
```bash
$ docker-compose down
$ sudo rm -rf /opt/docker
```
